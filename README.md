# GuessingGame

Welcome to the Guessing Game built in React Native using Expo! This simple game is played between the user and the phone (opponent), with the goal of guessing a number. The phone will use a randomly generated number to make its guess, and the user will inform the phone whether its guess is higher or lower than the number being guessed. The game will continue until the phone correctly guesses the number, at which point the game will end.

# Installation
To run this game, follow these steps:

1. Install Expo on your device or emulator.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run 'npm install' to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run 'expo start' to start the game.
Use the Expo client to open the game on your device or emulator.

# Playing the Game
Once the game is running, enter a number for the phone to guess. The phone will make a guess, and you will need to tell it whether its guess is higher or lower than the number you entered. The game will continue until the phone correctly guesses your number.
